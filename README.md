Online Course Completion Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a student will complete an online course based on their demographics, engagement metrics, and activity data. The model helps in identifying at-risk students early, enabling targeted interventions.

📌 Project Overview
Online education platforms collect a wide range of learner activity data — from time spent on the platform to the number of videos watched and assignments submitted. This project leverages that data to:

Predict course completion likelihood

Analyze key factors affecting student engagement

Provide actionable insights to educators and administrators

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling: Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Random Forest

Environment: Jupyter Notebook
