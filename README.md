Online Course Completion Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a student will complete an online course based on their demographics, engagement metrics, and activity data.
The goal is to help identify at-risk students early, enabling targeted interventions by educators.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Online learning platforms generate rich data about learners â€” from time spent on the platform to assignments submitted.
This project leverages that data to:

Predict course completion likelihood

Analyze factors influencing student engagement

Support educators in making data-driven interventions
