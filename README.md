Online Course Completion Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a student will complete an online course based on their demographics, engagement metrics, and activity data. The model helps identify at-risk students early, enabling targeted interventions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Online education platforms collect a wide range of learner activity data â€” from time spent on the platform to the number of videos watched and assignments submitted. This project leverages that data to:

Predict course completion likelihood

Analyze key factors affecting student engagement

Provide actionable insights to educators and administrators
