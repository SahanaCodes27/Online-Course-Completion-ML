# Online Course Completion ML Project

This project predicts whether a student will complete an online course based on various engagement and demographic features.

## Project Structure
- **Online_Course_Completion_Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with all steps (data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualizations).
- **online_course_completion.csv**: Dataset used for training and testing.
- **.gitattributes**: Git LFS configuration for handling large dataset files.

## ML Algorithm
- Logistic Regression (used for binary classification — predicting "completed" or "not completed").

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.
- Model training and evaluation using accuracy.
- Confusion matrix and feature importance visualization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
